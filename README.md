## 🌟 Project Overview  
Many people, including myself, spend hours trying on outfits only to feel unsure about what truly suits them.  
**ShapeFinder** was created to make that process simpler and more intuitive, helping users understand their body shape, visualize outfits digitally, and build confidence in their personal style while promoting mindful, sustainable fashion choices.  

## 🧠 Problem & Inspiration  
The project was born from the common frustration of spending time and money on clothes that don’t fit or feel right. ShapeFinder turns that uncertainty into creativity by helping users mix and match wardrobe pieces digitally before buying or styling them in real life.  

## 🎯 Features  
- Identify your **body shape** through guided input  
- Create a **personalized wardrobe** and visualize outfit combinations  
- Explore outfit ideas that fit your proportions and preferred aesthetic  
- Built with **clean architecture** and **reusable React components**

## 💡 What I Learned  
This project strengthened my skills in **full-stack development**, **UI design consistency**, and **building purposeful solutions** that make users feel more confident and creative.
